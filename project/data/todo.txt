Idea - Each state has a Tribunal de Contas Estadual (state audit court) that contains
aggregate information on how much each state is spending on each bill passed

Somehow filter such information to account to laws that were passed in recent years.
See if such laws are conditional cash transfers, which might be seen as ways to buy
votes

Descriptive data that might show that more expensive\spending bills are passed in
election years

Model a regression(?) logit(?) to show that increase in conditional cash transfers are
correlated to greater chances of reelection in the next period
