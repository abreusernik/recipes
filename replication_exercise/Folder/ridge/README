Replication exercise Extenstion: Implementation of Ridge Regression using Scikit-learn
and calculate marginal effects for each variable

1. pip install necessary packages in your Python interpreter (pandas, numpy, scikit)
2. Set the directories of input and output so the program finds the data.
3. Run the program and check the output at the end to see the 10 largest and the 10 smallest marginal effects of each variable
   according to the ridge regression, which represent the words most predictive for female and male posts respecitvely.
